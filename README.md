## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- SCSS

### Softwares used

- Koala (SCSS compiler)

### What I learned

I didn't really learned verry much as I already knew most of the elements i used, but I learned how to use the
```html : <Picture> ``` element in my code. Background images would've been an easier solution but because the image is part of the main content of the page I tried my best to keep it into the HTML instead of the CSS. I also learned how to make a globally acessible website from github. This was a good warm up to remember what I learned during classes.

### Continued development

The ```html : <Picture> ``` element is something that I still need some practice with as I couldn't fix the "flicker" effect when resizing the browser. (Image taking the full size of the container it is in an )
